This repository includes the code associated to the paper:
### Statistical Guarantees for Variational Autoencoders using PAC-Bayesian Theory, (Spotlight at NeurIPS 2023)
##### Sokhna Diarra Mbacke, Florence Clerc, Pascal Germain

The code uses the implementation of [Lipschitz-continuous neural networks](https://github.com/cemanil/LNets) provided by Anil et al., 2019. Part of the code is inspired by the implementation of [Lipschitz VAEs](https://github.com/FabianBarrett/Lipschitz_VAEs) provided by Barrett et al. 2022.
